#Notes:
- I don't agree with some css layouts in figma. Some of them are misleading and unnecessary. Therefore, I made some adjustments to meet the requirements;
- The right half is implemented.
- Data is fetched from https://www.certik.org/api/quickscan/project?projectId=pancakeswap.
The sample date does not have scores under 80 and 60, so you may only see green gauge and text color.
- d3-shape library is used.
